# N-bodySimulation #
* Simulation of Sun-Earth-Moon system that uses __Runge-Kutta method__ for numerically solving partial difierential equations of motion. 
* This can be  generalised to and N-body simulation (a star system, a galaxy or gas particles interacting through a quadratic potential, for example)
