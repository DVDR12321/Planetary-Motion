# NBodySimulation
  Simulation of Sun-Earth-Moon system that uses Runge-Kutta method for numerically solving partial difierential equations of motion. This can be  generalised to and N-body simulation ( a star system, a galaxy or gas particles interacting through a quadratic potential, for example)
